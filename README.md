Your prime function only returns the number 2 over and over again. Please come to my office hours if you think this is my mistake.

- `Exercise 5`	4.00/4
- `Exercise 6`	4.00/4
- `Exercise 7`	3.00/4	 Output is partially wrong, after freeing all the allocated bytes, it doesn't go all the way to base. There's a problem with merging segments I think.
